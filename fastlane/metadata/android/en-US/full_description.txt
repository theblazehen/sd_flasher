Why Root?
Android's security model prevents apps from writing to raw block devices. Root access is required to access /dev/block/* devices, unmount partitions, and write directly to storage hardware.

Supported Image Formats:
* Raw Image (.img)
* GZip Compressed (.img.gz, .gz)
* XZ Compressed (.img.xz, .xz)
* ZIP Archive (.zip)

Warning: This app writes directly to block devices. Double-check your target device before flashing!
